# arush-adabala-tax-liability
Bootstrap the Tax-Liability Domain

## Tech Stack

- Java 17 (Gradle toolchain)
- Gradle (wrapper included, no local Gradle install required)
- JUnit 5 (Jupiter) for tests

## Package Layout

All classes live under `com.uptimecrew.tax_liability`:

- `model` — domain types: `IncomeEvent`, `IncomeEventDraft`, `IncomeSource`, `Deduction`, `TaxBracket` (Java `record`)
- `service` — behavior over the domain model: `BracketResolver` (interface, returns `Optional<TaxBracket>`), `BracketRegistry` (queryable, immutable store of `TaxBracket` records)
- `exception` — the taxcalc domain exception hierarchy (see Day 4 below)

## Day 3 — Strategy, Factory, DI, Records & Mockito

- `BracketResolver` implementations — three interchangeable strategies, each `final` with `equals`/`hashCode`/`toString`:
  - `FederalBracketResolver` — the federal bracket schedule
  - `FlatStateBracketResolver` — a state that taxes all income at a single flat rate
  - `NoIncomeTaxStateBracketResolver` — a state that levies no income tax
- `BracketResolvers` — static factory (`federal()`, `flatRateState()`, `noIncomeTaxState()`) that returns the `BracketResolver` interface type, not a concrete class
- `TaxLiabilityService` — takes a `BracketResolver` via constructor injection (no `new` inside the service) and exposes `computeLiability(BigDecimal)`, which applies the resolved bracket's rate
- `TaxLiabilityServiceMockitoTest` — proves `TaxLiabilityService` delegates to its injected strategy using a Mockito `@Mock BracketResolver`, without depending on any concrete resolver

## Day 4 — Exceptions, SLF4J Logging & Exception-Path Tests

- `exception` package — a small two-level domain exception hierarchy:
  - `TaxLiabilityException` — abstract, extends `RuntimeException`, exposes `(String)` and `(String, Throwable)` constructors to subclasses
  - `InvalidIncomeException` — `final`; thrown when a caller-supplied taxable amount is invalid (e.g. negative)
  - `BracketResolutionFailedException` — `final`; thrown when an underlying bracket-resolution operation fails, chaining the original cause
- `FederalBracketResolver` and `FlatStateBracketResolver` both throw `InvalidIncomeException` on negative input instead of `IllegalArgumentException`, for consistency across the strategies that raise domain-typed failures; `FlatStateBracketResolver` additionally throws `BracketResolutionFailedException` (wrapping a synthetic `IOException`) when an amount requires its "extended bracket table". `NoIncomeTaxStateBracketResolver` is unchanged from Day 3 and remains on the happy path, still validating with `IllegalArgumentException`.
- `TaxLiabilityService` logs through SLF4J + Logback instead of `java.util.logging`: INFO before delegating and on a successful result, WARN (with the exception passed as the last argument, so the stack trace renders) when its injected strategy throws a `TaxLiabilityException`, then rethrows unchanged. It never catches `RuntimeException`, `Exception`, or `Throwable` — only the domain base.
- `TaxLiabilityServiceExceptionPathTest` — AssertJ + a Logback `ListAppender` attached to the service's logger, proving: the typed exception is thrown, the original cause is preserved, and exactly one WARN log line is emitted containing the exception message
- `TaxLiabilityServiceLoggingTest` — the same `ListAppender` pattern applied to the happy path, proving the service logs exactly one INFO line before delegating and one on a successful result

## Day 5 — TDD, AssertJ, JaCoCo & Test Data Builders

- `ProgressiveStateBracketResolver` — a fourth `BracketResolver` strategy, built test-first, for a state that taxes income progressively across multiple marginal-rate brackets (unlike `FlatStateBracketResolver`'s single flat rate); throws `InvalidIncomeException` on negative input and `BracketResolutionFailedException` for amounts requiring its synthetic "extended bracket table", mirroring the Day 4 exception paths on `FlatStateBracketResolver`
- `ProgressiveStateBracketResolverTest` — AssertJ (`assertThat`/`assertThatThrownBy`) exclusively, every test in explicit Arrange/Act/Assert form with a `methodUnderTest_condition_expectation` name and matching `@DisplayName`
- `TaxBracketTestDataBuilder` (`model` package, production source) — a fluent builder with one `with<Field>` method per `TaxBracket` component, valid defaults, a `build()` method, and a static `aTaxBracket()` factory; several Day 3/Day 4 tests now build their fixtures through it instead of the five-argument constructor
- JaCoCo wired into `build.gradle`: `jacocoTestReport` (HTML + XML) runs after every `test`, and `jacocoTestCoverageVerification` gates `./gradlew check` on a 70% branch-coverage floor

## Week 2 Day 1 — Postgres Schema, Constraints & Transactional Seed

- `db/` — schema-qualified DDL (`V1__schema.sql`), a transactional seed with an intentional-failure test (`V2__seed.sql`), verification SELECTs (`verify.sql`), and an ER diagram with schema decisions and trade-offs (`README.md`); see [`db/README.md`](db/README.md) for details.

## Week 2 Day 2 — Advanced SQL & Testcontainers

- `db/queries/` — four advanced-SQL query files against the Day 1 schema (JOINs, a CTE, window functions, `GROUP BY` + `HAVING`) plus `TaxpayerQueryIT`, a Testcontainers-backed JUnit 5 integration test that proves two of them against a real Postgres 16 container; see [`db/queries/README.md`](db/queries/README.md) for details.

## Week 2 Day 3 — Spring Boot Bootstrap, IoC & @SpringBootTest

- `Application` — the `@SpringBootApplication` entry point at the capstone package root; `build.gradle` gained the Spring Boot + dependency-management plugins and the `web`/`actuator`/`jdbc` starters
- `TaxLiabilityService` is `@Service`; `FederalBracketResolver` is `@Component` + `@Primary` — constructor injection only, no `@Autowired`, no hand-wired `new TaxLiabilityService(...)` in production code
- `config.BracketResolverProperties` / `config.BracketResolverConfig` — the three state-level strategies (`FlatStateBracketResolver`, `NoIncomeTaxStateBracketResolver`, `ProgressiveStateBracketResolver`) are wired as beans through a small `@Configuration` class, with their jurisdiction/rate/bracket values externalized into `application.yml` under `taxcalc.strategies` instead of hard-coded
- `application.yml` — profile-aware (`local` default, `test`), exposes the Actuator `/actuator/health` endpoint
- `ApplicationContextLoadIT` — `@SpringBootTest` proving the context boots and the injected `TaxLiabilityService` bean delegates to the `@Primary` strategy; `BracketResolverConfigIT` proves the three config-bound beans actually resolve to the values declared in `application.yml`, not just that the context doesn't crash; `ActuatorHealthIT` boots the app on a random port and hits `/actuator/health` over real HTTP with `TestRestTemplate`

## Week 2 Day 4 — Spring Data JPA: Entities, Repositories & @DataJpaTest

- `entity` — `Taxpayer`, `Bracket`, `Liability` map the Day 1 `taxcalc.taxpayer`/`bracket`/`liability` tables to `@Entity` classes: schema-qualified `@Table(schema = "taxcalc", ...)`, explicit `@Column` mappings, `BigDecimal` for money and `Instant` for timestamps, a LAZY `@OneToMany`/`@ManyToOne` pair between `Taxpayer` and `Liability`, and `equals`/`hashCode` on the primary key only. `Taxpayer` and `Bracket` each carry a single `TEXT` `id`; `Liability` keeps the composite `(taxpayer_id, tax_year)` primary key from the Day 1 DDL via `LiabilityId` (`@IdClass`) rather than introducing a surrogate id the schema doesn't have — see `Liability`'s Javadoc and `db/README.md`'s "Trade-offs" section for the reasoning.
- `repository` — `TaxpayerRepository`, `BracketRepository`, `LiabilityRepository`, one `JpaRepository` per entity, each with a derived query method and an explicit `@Query` for a lookup the naming convention can't express cleanly.
- `TaxLiabilityService` now takes `TaxpayerRepository` as a second constructor argument; its strategy invocation is `@Transactional`, so resolving a bracket and persisting the resulting `Taxpayer` happen in one transaction.
- `application.yml` gained a `spring.jpa` block: `ddl-auto: validate` (the schema is owned by `db/V1__schema.sql`, never Hibernate) and `open-in-view: false`.
- `TaxpayerRepositoryIT` — `@DataJpaTest` + `@AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = NONE)` + a Testcontainers `@ServiceConnection` Postgres container, proving a save → `findById` round-trip and that a derived finder returns only matching rows.

## Week 2 Day 5 — Spring Data MongoDB, Redis Cache & Polyglot Testcontainers

- `readmodel` — `TaxpayerReadModel`, a denormalized `@Document` embedding what the Day 4 JPA side lazily `@OneToMany`-joins, plus `TaxpayerReadModelRepository`, a `MongoRepository` with one derived finder; both the document and its embedded `EmbeddedLiability` implement `Serializable` since the document is also the value type cached behind Redis.
- `TaxLiabilityService` now takes `TaxpayerReadModelRepository` as a third constructor argument: `computeLiability` write-throughs a Mongo projection after the Postgres save, and a new `findById` method reads Redis (via `@Cacheable`) → Mongo → Postgres, in that order. `Application` gained `@EnableCaching`.
- `application.yml` gained `spring.data.mongodb`, `spring.data.redis`, and `spring.cache` (Redis, 60s TTL, no null-value caching) blocks. The `test` profile disables `spring.data.mongodb.auto-index-creation` and the `mongo`/`redis` health indicators, since `@Indexed`-driven auto index creation opens a real Mongo connection while the `MongoTemplate` bean is built (not lazily) — every `@SpringBootTest` that doesn't boot a Mongo/Redis container needed that guard, the same way `management.health.db.enabled: false` already guards the Postgres-only ones.
- **Health endpoint fix**: `management.endpoint.health.show-details` moved from `when-authorized` to `always`. This app has no Spring Security on the classpath, so nothing is ever "authorized" — `when-authorized` was silently hiding every health component, meaning `curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health` returned only `{"status":"UP"}` with no `mongo`/`redis`/`db` breakdown. `always` makes the component-level detail (e.g. `"mongo":{"status":"UP",...}`) visible on a plain, unauthenticated request, which the Day 5 acceptance checks for Tasks 1 and 3 depend on.
- `TaxpayerPolyglotIT` — one `@SpringBootTest` booting Postgres, Mongo, and Redis Testcontainers in parallel via `@ServiceConnection`, proving the write path lands in both Postgres and Mongo and that a repeated read is served from the Redis cache.
- `TaxpayerReadModelRepositoryIT` — a `@DataMongoTest` against a real Testcontainers Mongo, proving a save → `findById` round-trip and that `findByFilingStatus` returns only taxpayers matching the requested status (not a Mongo transaction, so each test clears the collection in `@AfterEach`).
- `ApplicationContextLoadIT` (W2 D4) gained its own Mongo `@Container`, since its existing `computeLiability` call now exercises the new Mongo write-through path.
- `EmbeddedLiability.equals`/`hashCode` compare every field, not just `(taxYear, bracketId)`: unlike `Taxpayer`/`Bracket`/`Liability`, this is a value object embedded inline rather than an entity with its own id, so two liabilities in the same year and bracket that differ in amount must not compare equal.
